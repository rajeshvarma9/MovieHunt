# MovieHunt

Developed a responsive movie search web application using React.js, fetching data from the OMDb API to display a list of movies.
Implemented a search functionality allowing users to input movie titles and dynamically update the displayed movies based on the search query.
Created reusable React components, such as MovieCard, to modularize the code and efficiently display movie information, including titles, release years, and posters, with a fallback placeholder for missing poster images.
